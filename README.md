Hi, I am Lovrenc Pavlin.
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Water resources systems at the Techincal University of Vienna. I am researching surface and subsurface water interatctions. 
In my work I use different Hydrological models (HydroGeoSphere, HPP) and my main programming language is R.

My main interests are: catchment hydrology, macropores, climate change and hillslope processes.
I am currently learning more about data science and data analytics.
